# Otherbind
Otherbind is a program written in C++ and Qt that allows for the automatic changing of keyboard layouts when running games through steam. The main purpose of this is to make the process of playing games with a non-QWERTY keyboard layout (i.e. DVORAK) easier. This solution is superior to setting a layout changing keybind in the OS because it will allow for automatic changing back and forth when the chat is opened.
